Write a function called rename_obj that takes a string as an argument to rename a selected Maya object.



(Hint: use my_selection = maya.cmds.ls(selection=True) This assigns any selected objects in the scene to a list called “my_selection”.)
Explain what a for loop is, and write a function that uses it to print the name of each object in a list.


 a for loop is A while loop runs a block of code until (or "while") a condition is met. While Loops are based on a condition, for example "Print gallons of fuel while there is fuel in the tank"

my_selection  = [name1, name2, name3, name4]

my_selection = maya.cmds.ls(selection = True)

for my_selection
perform
print(my_selection)



(Hint: This list of objects could be called “my_selection”)
Explain what the range command does, and write a function that uses it to print the numbers 0 through 9.
the range function returns a numeric progression in a list
my_selection = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(range(10))



Write a function called print_parents that takes a list of Maya objects as an arguments and prints each node and its parent node. - (Hint: use listRelatives command.)



Create four objects in the scene. Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Torus.
Parent Torus under Cylinder. Then parent Cylinder under Sphere. Then parent Sphere under Cube.
Use the example hierarchy below for the objects required for the print_parent function.
( Torus > Cylinder > Sphere > Cube)
Format a print statement using % notation that list the selected object and all of its parent nodes.
(eg: “Selected Geometry: , Parents: ”)

import maya.cmds.polyCube()
import maya.cmds.polySphere()
import maya.cmds.polyCylinder()
import maya.cmds.polyTorus()

cmds.parent( 'Sphere1', 'cube1', relative=True )
cmds.parent( 'sphere1', 'cylinder1', relative=True )
cmds.parent( 'cylinder1', 'torus1', relative=True )


print("%s is parent to %s is parent to %s is parent to %s is parent to %s")
